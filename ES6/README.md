# Welcome to ES6 Tutorial 

ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting.

## How to run code

JavaScript can run on any browser, any host, and any OS.The text editor helps you to write your source code (Example Text Editors : Windows Notepad, Notepad++, Emacs, vim or vi etc.). Also,  **Node.js** can be used to run JavaScript without a browser support. It uses Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute the code. You may download Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform. Node is available at

## ES6 New Features

- Promises
One of the most powerful aspects of JavaScript is how easily it handles asynchronous programming. As a language created for the Web, JavaScript needed to be able to respond to asynchronous user interactions such as clicks and key presses from the beginning. Node.js further popularized asynchronous programming in JavaScript by using callbacks as an alternative to events. As more and more programs started using asynchronous programming, events and callbacks were no longer powerful enough to support everything developers wanted to do. _Promises_ are the solution to this problem.


- Arrow Functions
- Modules
