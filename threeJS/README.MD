# Three.js — a JavaScript library built around the WebGL APIs.

Both OpenGL and WebGL are relatively complex.
Three.js is here to help. It’s an open-source library that simplifies the creation of WebGL tools and environments. It covers the majority of the lower level programming involved in developing GPU-accelerated 3D animations.

Three.js is to WebGL what jQuery is to JavaScript, offering declarative syntax loved by so many, and abstracting away the headaches for 3D in the browser. Let’s review it, get a general overview of syntax and look at how to get started if you’re new to the game of 3D.
