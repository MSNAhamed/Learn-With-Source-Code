# Welcome to React Native 

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React,
 letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.
 
 With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, 
 or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable 
 from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You 
 just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.
 
 ## React Native Features
 
 
 
    React − This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript.

    Native − You can use native components controlled by JavaScript.

    Platforms − React Native supports IOS and Android platform.
    
 
 ## React Native Advantages

    
    JavaScript − You can use the existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps.

    Code sharing − You can share most of your code on different platforms.

    Community − The community around React and React Native is large, and you will be able to find any answer you need.
    

 ## React Native Limitations

    Native Components − If you want to create native functionality which is not created yet, you will need to write some platform specific code.

The data inside React Components is managed by state and props.

## Difference between State and Props

The state is mutable while props are immutable. This means that state can be updated in the future while props cannot be updated.
