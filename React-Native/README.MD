# Welcome to React Native 

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React,
 letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.
 
 With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, 
 or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable 
 from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You 
 just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.
