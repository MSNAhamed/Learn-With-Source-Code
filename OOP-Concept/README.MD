# Welcome to Object Oriented Programming Concept

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many
concepts such as **inheritance**, **data binding**, **polymorphism**
etc.

Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. 
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design 
a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software 
development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

- Object
- Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

## Object

Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. 
For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. 
It can be physicalObject

Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.
Class

Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. and logical.

## Class

Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

## Inheritance

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

## Polymorphism

When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.

In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Another example can be to speak something e.g. cat speaks meaw, dog barks woof etc.
