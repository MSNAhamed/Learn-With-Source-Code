# Welcome to WebGL

## What is WebGL ?

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is the new standard for 3D graphics on the Web, It is designed for the purpose
of rendering 2D graphics and interactive 3D graphics. It is derived from OpenGL's ES 2.0 library
which is a low-level 3D API for phones and other mobile devices. WebGL provides similar functionality
of ES 2.0 (Embedded Systems) and performs well on modern 3D graphics hardware.
